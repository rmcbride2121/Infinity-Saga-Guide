# Infinity-Saga-Guide
An interactive guide to the first three phases of movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, also known as The Infinity Sage!

The goal of this app is to serve as a guide to the MCU for some one that has never seen a single Marvel movie and needs to know which to watch and which you can skip.

This app features a timeline of all the movies of the MCU, listed from left to right. Each film will be represented by their official movie poster, and the year they were released above. There will be a dropdown menu above that can switch the order from release date to chronological order.

When you click on each poster, you can view all information related to that movie. This will include a plot summary, characters introduced, if an infinity stone was featured and the level of importance of each film in the grand scheme of the universe. Each film's importance to the overall story will be ranked as either low, medium or high.

Users can also rate the each film themselves using a like or dislike button, and leave comments.
